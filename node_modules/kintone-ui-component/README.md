## Installation
kintone UI Component is available as UMD, CDN and npm package.

### UMD
Please use `kuc.min.js` downloaded from [releases page](https://github.com/kintone-labs/kintone-ui-component/releases).
```
./umd/kuc.min.js
```

### CDN
Please use these CDN link.

- If you want to load the latest version of kintone UI Component:
  ```
  https://unpkg.com/kintone-ui-component/umd/kuc.min.js
  ```

- If you want to specify the version and load it (specify the version number after the project name):
  ```
  https://unpkg.com/kintone-ui-component@1.0.0/umd/kuc.min.js
  ```

> unpkg is not supported by Cybozu. We recommend you to use it for verification.<br />
> In a production environment, please use UMD to avoid the possible effects of unpkg technical obstacle and glitches.

### npm
Please install and use `kintone-ui-component` with npm.
```bash
npm install kintone-ui-component
```

## Usage

```javascript
// UMD
const Kuc = Kucs["1.x.x"];

const text = new Kuc.Text({
  value: "this is text!"
});
```

```javascript
// ES modules
import { Text } from "kintone-ui-component/lib/text";

const text = new Text({
  value: "this is text!"
});
text.addEventListener("change", event => {
  console.log(`text value is changed to ${event.detail.value}`);
});
```

> When using a version on and after v1.4.0, please use `Kucs["1.x.x"]` instead of Kuc and specify your expected version (ex. `new Kucs["1.4.0"].Button()`).<br>
> The rendered components' tags and class names will include the version number.<br>
> You may still use `Kuc` as a global variable but **note that it may be conflicting when adding two or more `kuc.min.js` files** on Kintone customization or plug-in. In this case, the `Kuc` object refers to the last loaded `kuc.min.js` file.<br>
> In case that there is only one `kuc.min.js` file in the Kintone system or there is no problem with using last loaded `kuc.min.js` file, you can use Kuc object. Please remove `const Kuc = Kucs['1.x.x'];` line.
> When using a version before v1.4.0, please use `Kuc` as a global variable but **note that it may be conflicting when adding two or more `kuc.min.js` files** on Kintone customization or plug-in.<br>
> Please visit [Quick Start](https://ui-component.kintone.dev/docs/getting-started/quick-start#installation) and [Version conflicts issue and solution](https://ui-component.kintone.dev/docs/guides/version-conflicts-issue-solution) for more information!
